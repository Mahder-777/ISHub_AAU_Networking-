1. A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices (like computers, servers, printers) that share data and resources through communication channels.
Main purposes: Resource sharing, Communication 
2. Area Coverage
 Example LAN covers Small area (e.g., office). WAN Very large (country/world): the internet. MAN covers a city or large campus, City government network. PAN covers few meters like Bluetooth between phone and earbuds.
3. Client-Server: it is a centralized model. Central server provides resources, clients request services and the server provides with the required resource. 
            Peer-to-Peer (P2P): It is decentralized model. All computers act as equals (peers) and share data directly. 
4. Centralized data access
Efficient communication
Resource sharing
Cost saving 

5.6.7 Star topology-all devices are connected to a central device (like a switch or hub).
Bus topology-all devices are connected to a single central cable (called the backbone).
Mesh topology-each device is connected to each other there is no central server.
Ring topology: devices are connected in a circular loop and data travels in one direction.

		Star: Advantage: failure of one node doesn't affect others
	Disadvantage: if the hub or switch fails the entire network fails

	
		Bus: advantage: uses less cable and inexpensive	
                                                                               Disadvantage: cable failure affects the network




Star topology is most common.
Because: Easy to add/remove devices
                 Fault isolation is simple
                 High performance with switches
8. Switch: Connects multiple devices on a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct device.
Router: Connects different networks, routes data using IP addresses, and provides internet access.
Hub: Broadcasts incoming data to all ports (not smart like switch).
Access Point: Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network (Wi-Fi).
9. modem-Converts digital data to/from analog.
Routers -Connects multiple devices to a network and manages traffic
10. Switch: Layer 2 (Data Link) — uses MAC addresses
       Router: Layer 3 (Network) — uses IP addresses

11. Transmission media are the physical or wireless pathways used to transmit data.
1. Guided (Wired Media):
Twisted Pair Cable – e.g., Ethernet cable (Cat5, Cat6)
Coaxial Cable – e.g., used in cable TV 
Fiber Optic Cable – e.g., used for high-speed internet
2. Unguided (Wireless Media):
Radio waves – Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
Microwaves – Point-to-point communication
Infrared – TV remotes, short-range communication
12. UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair): No shielding, cheaper, more flexible, but more susceptible to interference
  STP (Shielded Twisted Pair): Has foil shielding, more expensive, less flexible, but better at resisting interference.
13. BNC: Used with coaxial cables (older Ethernet, CCTV systems)
      RJ45: Used with twisted pair cables (modern Ethernet networks)
14. Single-mode: Uses a single light path (laser), thinner core (9µm), longer distances (up to 100km), more expensive
       Multi-mode: Uses multiple light paths (LED), thicker core (50-62.5µm), shorter distances (up to 2km), less expensive

15. - Cable TV/internet (HFC networks)
- Older Ethernet networks (10BASE2, 10BASE5)
- CCTV systems
- Radio antenna connections

17. Straight-through cable: Connects different devices (e.g., PC to switch).
      Crossover cable: Connects similar devices (e.g., PC to PC, switch to switch).
Purpose: Ensures transmit and receive wires are correctly matched for communication.
18. Crimping tool – attaches RJ45 connectors to cable ends
      Cable tester – checks wiring continuity and correctness
      Wire stripper – removes insulation without damaging wires
19. - Simplex: One-way communication (e.g., keyboard to computer, TV broadcast)
    - Half-Duplex: Two-way communication, but only one direction at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie)
   - Full-Duplex: Simultaneous two-way communication (e.g., telephone conversation, modern      Ethernet)
20. Sender – Originates the message
Receiver – Accepts the message
Message – Information being communicated
Medium – Channel through which message travels
Protocol – Set of rules for communication
21. Protocols define rules for communication including:
- How to establish/maintain/terminate connections
- Data format and encoding
- Error handling
- Flow control
Without protocols, devices wouldn't be able to understand each other.
22. - Application: User selects file to send, application protocol (e.g., FTP) initiates transfer 
      - Presentation: File may be encrypted or compressed
      -Session: Establishes, maintains, and terminates the connection 
      -Transport: Breaks data into segments, adds port numbers, ensures reliable delivery
       -Network: Adds IP addresses, routes packets between networks 
       - Data Link: Adds MAC addresses, creates frames, handles local delivery
       -Physical: Converts to bits, transmits over physical medium
23. - HTTP: Application                                                           - Ethernet: Data Link

40.  ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses. When a device needs to send to an IP, it broadcasts an ARP request to learn the destination's MAC address.
41. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) It is used to transfer web pages and data between web servers and clients (browsers) on port 80.
42. Translates domain names into IP addresses. It simplifies users search rather than IP address we can search by name 
43. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)-Automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS settings to devices on a network. Saves time—no need to configure each device manually.
44. SSH: Secure remote access
DNS: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
DHCP: Assigns IP configurations automatically to network devices.
TCP: Ensures reliable delivery of data between devices.
SMTP: Email sending
45. Switching uses Mac address while routing uses IP address. Switching works on same LAN while routing connect different networks.
46. VLAN Allows to divide a physical network into multiple logical networks. 
Uses:  to improve security, reduce broadcast traffic, and organize devices more efficiently
47. A default gateway is the IP address of a router that connects a local network to external networks (like the internet).
Importance: Without it, devices can only communicate within the same subnet.
                       It enables external communication (e.g., to websites or other networks). 
48. Phishing – Tricking users into revealing sensitive information.
Malware – Malicious software like viruses, worms, ransomware.
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) – Attacker intercepts communication between two parties.
49. A firewall is a security system (hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.
How it protects: Blocks unauthorized access
                              Filters malicious traffic
                              Enforces security policies
50. - Detects and removes malware
      - Prevents infection from network sources
      - Scans network traffic for threats
      - Provides real-time protection
51. NAT translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses for Internet access. It conserves IPv4 addresses by allowing many devices to share one public IP.
Commonly used in:
- Home routers
- Corporate networks
- Anywhere private IPs need Internet access
