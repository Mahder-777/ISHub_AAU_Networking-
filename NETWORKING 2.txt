1. STP has additional shielding around the pairs to reduce interference and it is also more expensive due to the extra shielding. While UTP has no shielding and is less expensive 
2. Advantage: higher transmission rates over long distance 
                         Low noise level 
      Disadvantage: it is more labor intensive 
                              Not all LAN system work readily over STP
                              More expensive
3. Coaxial cable is a type of cable with a of a core of copper wire surrounded by insulation, a braided metal shielding, and an outer cover. Where the Shielding protects transmitted data by absorbing stray electronic signals, called noise, so that they do not get onto the cable and distort the data.
Uses: cable internet, cable TV networks
4. BNC connector’s function is to provide secure quick connect or disconnect interface maintaining the shielding property of coaxial cable.  
Uses: video surveillance system
          Radio antenna connections 
          Test equipment connections

6. Cat 5e:  - Maximum data rate: 1 Gbps
                   - Maximum range: 100 meters at 1 Gbps
Cat 6: - Maximum data rate: 10 Gbps (up to 55 meters), 1 Gbps at 100 meters
                  - Maximum range: 55 meters for 10 Gbps, 100 meters for 1 Gbps
7. A, Single-mode fiber (SMF): uses a very small core (8-10 microns), Uses laser light source and it is designed for long-distance communication (up to 100 km) it is also more expensive but higher bandwidth
B, Multi-mode fiber (MMF): uses larger core (50-62.5 microns), uses LED light source and shorter distance (up to 2 km) also less expensive but lower bandwidth.
8. Their first difference is Light sourse. Single-mode uses lasers, multi-mode uses LEDs. Also Single-mode can transmit much farther since (100km > 2km). Another difference is cost and bandwidth single mode is more expensive and has higher bandwidth compare to multi-mode.
9. It is immune to IMF: optical fibers carry digital data signals in the form of modulated pulses of light so it cannot be tapped, and its data cannot be stolen.
Speed: Fiber-optic cable is good for very high-speed, high-capacity data transmission because of the purity of the signal and lack of signal attenuation.

15. Cost: twisted par has the lowest where coaxial is medium but the fiber optic is the most expensive than the others,
Speed: fiber optics has high speed compared to the others due to lack of signal attenuation. But coaxial has moderate and twisted pair has the lowest spped.
Interference: twisted pair has moderate interference while the coaxial has some interference because they use shielding but the fiber optic is very resistance since it uses light instead of electrical signal.
16. it is a conceptual framework that describes how data is transmitted between devices in a network. And also defines the procedures and structure how devices communicate.
17. Simplex: TV
      Half -duplex: walkie talkie
      Full-duplex: telephone
18. Simple half duplex is a two way communication but not simultaneously (one at a time) where as full duplex is a communication of both directions at once.
19. They are essential because they define the rules for communication, handle error detection and correction and also provide security mechanisms.

20. Sender: the device at generates the message. 
      Message: the information being communicated
      Medium: physical path for transmission (cable or wireless) 
      Protocol: It is a set of rules that govern data communication. It represents an agreement or convention between the communicating devices
      Receiver: It is the device that receives or accepts the message.
